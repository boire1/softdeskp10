# SoftDesk

SoftDesk is an API built with Django REST framework for project management and issue tracking, divided into three key sub-applications.

    user_app handles user management, authentication, as well as profiles and permissions.

    proj_contrib_app is dedicated to project and contributor management, allowing for the creation of projects and the assignment of roles and responsibilities to project members.

    issue_com_app focuses on tracking and managing issues related to a project, offering features to comment, prioritize, and tag these issues, while also associating each issue with an author and an assigned contributor.

## Features


in this `SoftDesk API`, users can `sign up`, `log in`, and `manage projects`, `issues`, and `comments`. 
They can `create projects` and `become contributors` to existing projects. 
They can also `add, view, edit, or delete` `issues and comments`, but only in `projects` where they are `contributors` or for which they are the `authors`. 
Session security is ensured by `JWT`, and users have the option to `log out`.
The API provides stringent access control to ensure that users can only interact with authorized resources.
